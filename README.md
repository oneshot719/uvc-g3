All things UVC-G3 Cameras / Samples / Builds / Scripts


So I am building this repo because lots of ppl are asking about my setup and it's easiest to document it here for reference.

A bit about my environment:

ISP: Comcast ~200MB download / ~10MB Upload

Modem: SURFboard SB6183 DOCSIS 3.0 ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MA5U1FW/ )

Router: Ubiquity Edge Router Lite ( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00CPRVF5K )

Switch: TP-Link 16 port dumb switch ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HAJQGA )

   #note on the switch, i chose a dumb one because i'm a tight ass ($) but if i could re-do it, i'd probably buy a POE switch to make things look cleaner

   #Hanging off the switch are my POE injectors for cameras (and AP's) and I have up to 200 foot cat5e cable ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BY8XERI ) runs to the cameras that i terminated myself.

I rolled my own NVR because IMO the unifi nvr is stupid for the price

Server: i3@3.5 Ghz w/ 8GB ram 500GB sata OS volume ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01230V2U6 )

Added HD: 5TB internal drive ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKFEEBW/ ) <-- I used this one because it was cheap and pulled it out of the enclosure and put inside the server. Again tight ass ($)

OS: Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS

NVR Software: Version 3.7.1 ( https://www.ubnt.com/download/unifi-video/unifi-nvr )
